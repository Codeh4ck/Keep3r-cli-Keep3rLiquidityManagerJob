# Job A

This is the simplest job we can find as well as the simplest script to write. It doesn't have any strategies nor complex mechanisms. It's simply a job with a single function that must be called. For this reason, the script we have provided for `JobA` serves as the perfect foundation for users to use at the time of writing scripts for more complex jobs.
